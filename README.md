This project is an interesting amalgamation of rails (mainly for migrations) and
aws lambda functions.

Not sure how to arrange everything.

Aside from the usual rails stuff:

1. the /hasura folder contains hasura metadata

2. the lib/lambda folder contains ruby lambda functions which should be tested
   by rspec
